## 4.  Procedure

To apply for the Stacks Open Internet Grants Program, your application shall fulfill the following criteria:

-  it shall be a software-based project, which contributes to the advancement of the Stacks ecosystem;

-  You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;

The open grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:

**(i)  Application Review Phase:**

This phase consists of the following steps:
- Submit an application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/). 
  - *The Project Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application.*
  - *After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github.*
- Receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
- Revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
- Wait for the formal review and determinations for your funding round to be announced.

**(ii)  Onboarding Phase:**

The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:
- Project Lead verifies identity using a third-party KYC service.
- Project Lead (aka appicant) signs contract and a representative from the Stacks Foundation countersigns contract.
- Initial Payment disbursed at the conclusion of the Onboarding Phase.
- Begin work on your project.

**(iii)  Milestone Deliverable Phase:**

Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart] for details), but in general, a Milestone Phase consists of:
- Post a link to the completed work and request a review by commenting on your Github issue.  
- Allow the Stacks community an opportunity to review and comment on your work verifying it is done as outlined in the project application.  
- Once it is determined the work matches the approved project application your Milestone Payment will be disbursed. 

**(iv)  Final Deliverable Phase:**

The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase you will be awarded your final payment.
