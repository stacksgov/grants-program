## Grants Program

The goal of Stacks Grants are to fund infrastructure development, community resources, tools, research, and education that serve our mission of a user owned internet, powered by the Stacks Blockchain.

**Stacks Foundation Grant Program {Beta}**

We will begin with a beta grants program to build momentum, test our process, and award USD grants up to $5k. The beta program will run through the launch of STX 2.0, at which point we have the opportunity to propose upgrades, including award grants in STXs, a larger review committee, and grants awarded in larger denominations. 

## **Categories**

- **Tools and Services.** Are you a web developer interested in building tools that make the protocol easier to interact with? Are you interested in increasing decentralization, data resiliency, and data portability? Can you build tools and services that make it easier for miners, developers, and tokenholders to interact with STX? *Examples: a Rosetta API gateway, STX Stacking wallet, STX custody solutions, alternate explorer, custom mining tools / dashboards, chain visualization / analytics, etc.*
- **Education, Evangelism, and Collaboration.** Are you experienced in communication, marketing, community or creative? Create resources that support or grow the community.  *Examples: videos, documentation, tutorials, workshops, working groups, etc.*
- **Core Protocol Development.** Are you a blockchain developer or computer science researcher? **** Build core infrastructure that helps progress a user-owned internet. *Examples: alternate implementations, contributions to stacks-blockchain reference implementation, etc.*
- **Wish list or Wildcard**. Ready to contribute but not sure were to start? We're crowdsourcing ideas from across our ecosystem that best serve our mission. Check out our wish list for ideas or create your own proposal for a project you believe will add value to the ecosystem and explain why.

## Grants Application

The grants proposal process was designed with input from the community. Applications are a part of the conversation with the STX ecosystem to seek feedback, input and collaborators. Applicants may benefit from presenting their idea in a blog post, video demo, or forum discussion to get more input and feedback. We strongly encourage applicants to consider how to continue sharing proposal updates, progress, and final deliverables with the community over time. 

**Evaluation Criteria**

- Must further the mission of a user owned internet
- Contributions must be open source or use a permissive license (where required)
- Grantees must verify their ID and sign a contract to obtain funding, restrictions may apply to citizens of OFAC countries
- Must be able to be completed within 4-8 weeks, and at or under $5,000 from a time commitment perspective. This will expand as we shift from beta to a scaled program at the end of 2020.
-  Grant applications should clearly outline the project's purpose, who benefits, how the project will serve the mission, a measurable outcome, relevant experience from the individual/team, risks, and links to community input, research, or supporting work relevant to your project.
